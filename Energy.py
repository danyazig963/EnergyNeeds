st.markdown("Humans need energy in various forms such as electricity, heating, cooling, cooking, and car fuel. However, energy production faces many challenges, particularly environmental ones like global warming and pollution of air, soil, and water. These challenges lead us to use clean energy sources. The energy sector includes production, transmission, storage, and consumption, making these systems complex. Renewable energies, although useful, are unstable and this instability adds complexity to the systems. This is why the shift towards renewable energy is slow.")
st.markdown("I believe that one solution to these challenges is to simplify energy systems and use selection algorithms. By simplifying the algorithms, even people without specialized knowledge can understand their energy supply system with basic information. Once they know the system's dimensions, they can estimate the costs and switch to using clean energy sources with a clear vision.")
st.markdown("This web application uses a step-by-step algorithm to determine the appropriate dimensions for an energy supply system. By inputting the daily energy requirement and annual average wind speed, the algorithm calculates the necessary dimensions for key components such as the wind turbine for electricity generation and the electrolyzer for hydrogen energy storage. Hydrogen is a versatile energy carrier that can be used as electricity, gas, and even car fuel.")
st.markdown("I am currently working on expanding this program to include other forms of clean energy so that users can have a wider range of options to choose from. This will allow them to select the most suitable system for their energy needs based on their current circumstances. I hope that my efforts can make a small contribution toward improving both society and the environment.")
st.markdown("If you want to know exactly how this algorithm works, you can read my published article titled [Hydrogen mini-Factory for domestic purposes (wind version)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40205-6). With the help of this article, you can get more details to design your energy supply system.")
